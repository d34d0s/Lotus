# **Lotus API Reference ðŸª·**

Welcome to the **Lotus API Reference**! ðŸŒ¸  
This section provides a quick overview of all the major layers, utilities, and experimental features in **Lotus**. Below youâ€™ll find links to the specific **API References** for each module, ranging from core systems like **Memory** and **Graphics**, to cutting-edge features like **Lotus Plug**.

Before diving into the detailed API references, make sure youâ€™re familiar with the overall structure and functionality of the **Core Module**, which serves as the foundation for all other modules.

### Quick Links ðŸª·  
| [Lotus Core API](core/core.md) | The foundational system of **Lotus**, including essential layers like **Memory**, **Platform**, and **Graphics**. |  
| [Lotus 2D API](2D/2D.md) | The **2D** module for game development, including graphics, input, and physics systems. |  
| [Lotus 3D API](3D/3D.md) | The **3D** module for game development, including rendering, physics, and scene management. |  
| [Lotus ECS API](ecs/ecs.md) | The **Entity-Component-System** module, providing a data-driven architecture for game object management. |  
| [Lotus Utility API](core/utility.md) | A collection of general programming utilities aimed at enhancing game development. |  
| [Lotus Next API](next/next.md) | The **Next-Gen Features** module, including experimental features like the **Lotus Plug** API for engine-level plugin support. |

### How to Use This Guide ðŸª·

- **Start with the Core API**: Since **Lotus Core** provides the foundational systems (like **Memory**, **Platform**, and **Graphics**), it is essential to understand how these layers work before diving into the other modules. Begin with the **[Core API Reference](core/core.md)**.
  
- **Explore the Specific API References**: Once you're comfortable with the Core, you can start exploring the documentation for the other modules:
    - The **[2D API Reference](2D/2D.md)** provides details on 2D rendering, input, and physics systems.
    - The **[3D API Reference](3D/3D.md)** covers 3D rendering, scene management, and physics systems.
    - The **[ECS API Reference](ecs/ecs.md)** dives into the **Entity-Component-System** architecture for data-driven game object management.
    - The **[Utility API Reference](utility/utility.md)** includes general-purpose utility functions to streamline your game development process.
    - The **[Next API Reference](next/next.md)** introduces experimental features like the **Lotus Plug** system for advanced plugin architecture.

- **Follow the Structure**: Each **API Reference** provides an overview of the layerâ€™s components and functions, how to use them, and some examples to get you started. Be sure to check out each API's **functions** and **structures** for a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities.
