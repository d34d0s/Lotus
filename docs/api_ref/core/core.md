# **Lotus Core API Reference ðŸª·**

Welcome to the **Lotus Core API Reference**! ðŸŒ¸  
This section serves as a quick overview and hub for the core API of **Lotus**. Here, youâ€™ll find links to the detailed documentation for each major layer of **Lotus Core**, including **Memory**, **Platform**, **Graphics**, and related sublayers.

Before diving into the specific API references, please ensure youâ€™re familiar with the overall structure and initialization of the **Lotus Core Module**. The core module serves as the foundation for all other modules, and understanding how it works will help you use the APIs effectively.

### Core API Structure ðŸª·
Each API reference in this section focuses on the specific functionalities provided by **Lotus**â€™ core systems:

- **Memory API**: Functions for allocating, freeing, and managing memory in a way that is aligned and optimized for performance.
- **Platform API**: Includes functions for input handling, OS-specific platform abstractions, event handling, and basic file operations.
- **Event API**: Contains the event handling system for window events and custom event dispatching.
- **Input API**: Handles input from keyboard, mouse, and gamepad devices.
- **Graphics API**: Contains functions for rendering, shader management, and rendering 2D/3D objects. You will also find information about camera management here.
- **Camera API**: Provides functions for managing the camera and supporting both 2D and 3D configurations.

### How to Use This Guide ðŸª·
- Use the links above to navigate to the specific API you need.
- If youâ€™re new to **Lotus**, start with the **Memory API** and **Platform API** to understand how the engine handles the basics of memory management and platform interactions.
- For rendering and camera functionality, check out the **Graphics API** and **Camera API** documentation.
- Explore the **Event API** and **Input API** to understand how the engine handles user input and system events.

Once you're familiar with the core concepts and APIs, youâ€™ll be ready to integrate and extend **Lotus** in your own projects!
