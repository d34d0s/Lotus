### **Lotus Utility Layer API Reference ðŸª·**

---

Welcome to the **Lotus Utility Layer API Reference**! ðŸª·  
The **Utility Layer** is a collection of essential functions designed to assist game developers with various tasks. These functions cover operations like memory management, file I/O, data structure handling, and math utilities, among others.

This layer doesn't directly modify the core systems of **Lotus** but provides fundamental tools that are helpful in everyday development. The utilities available in this section help you manage memory efficiently, manipulate data, perform mathematical calculations, and manage files and data structures.

### **Utility Layer Structure ðŸª·**

This reference section covers multiple utilities that aid in tasks such as array manipulation, file handling, data storage, and mathematical operations:

- **Array API**: Allows you to create, manage, and manipulate dynamic arrays.
- **File I/O API**: Provides functions to interact with files on the system (e.g., read, write, delete, copy).
- **Hashmap API**: Implements a simple hashmap to store key-value pairs.
- **Linked List API**: Implements a doubly linked list for sequential data management.
- **Math API**: Provides mathematical utilities, including vector and matrix operations, as well as functions for common calculations like dot and cross products.
