None.

**Return Type**:  
`ubyte2` - The ID of the newly created entity.

**Detailed Explanation**:  
This function initializes a new entity and returns its ID. Entities are the basic building blocks of the ECS architecture and can have components attached to them later. Use this function to dynamically add new entities to your game world.

---
<a id="destroy_entity"></a>
#### **`destroy_entity()`** ðŸª·

**Description**:  
Destroys an existing entity, freeing its resources.

**Parameters**:  
- `entity_id` (`ubyte2`): The ID of the entity to destroy.

**Return Type**:  
None.

**Detailed Explanation**:  
This function removes the specified entity from the ECS system and frees any resources associated with it. Once destroyed, the entity is no longer valid, and any components attached to it are also cleaned up.

---
<a id="register_component"></a>
#### **`register_component()`** ðŸª·

**Description**:  
Registers a new component type in the ECS system.

**Parameters**:  
- `stride` (`ubyte4`): The size (in bytes) of a single component instance.
- `component_id` (`ubyte`): The unique ID assigned to the component.

**Return Type**:  
None.

**Detailed Explanation**:  
This function registers a new component type, which can then be used by entities in the ECS system. The `stride` parameter specifies the size of the component's data, which is used for memory allocation. Components are essential for adding data to entities.

<a id="unregister_component"></a>
#### **`unregister_component()`** ðŸª·

**Description**:  
Unregisters a component type from the ECS system, making it unavailable for future use.

**Parameters**:  
- `component_id` (`ubyte`): The unique ID assigned to the component to unregister.

**Return Type**:  
None.

**Detailed Explanation**:  
This function removes a component type from the ECS system, freeing its associated resources. Once unregistered, components of that type cannot be added to entities. This is useful when you want to clean up component types that are no longer needed.

---
<a id="add_component"></a>
#### **`add_component()`** ðŸª·

**Description**:  
Adds a component of a specific type to an entity.

**Parameters**:  
- `entity_id` (`ubyte2`): The ID of the entity to which the component will be added.
- `component_id` (`ubyte`): The ID of the component to add.

**Return Type**:  
None.

**Detailed Explanation**:

**Return Type**:  
None.

**Detailed Explanation**:  
This function registers a system, which operates on entities that have the specified component. The system is responsible for running logic, such as movement or rendering, on those entities during the game loop. Systems allow for efficient processing of multiple entities at once based on component data.

---
<a id="unregister_system"></a>
#### **`unregister_system()`** ðŸª·

**Description**:  
Unregisters a previously registered system.

**Parameters**:  
- `component_id` (`ubyte`): The component ID associated with the system to unregister.
