# **Lotus ExamplesðŸª·**

Welcome to the **Lotus Examples**! ðŸŒ¸  
This directory contains simple, self-contained examples to help you get started with using **Lotus** in your game development projects. The examples aim to showcase key engine features and demonstrate how to use **Lotus**'s modular architecture to build games and applications.

Each example includes explanations of how the engine is initialized, how various features are used, and the expected outcome. These examples are a great starting point for anyone new to **Lotus** or game development in general.

## **Overview of Examples ðŸª·**

1. **Hello Triangle**: This is the simplest example, rendering a single triangle to the screen using **Lotus 2D** and **Lotus ECS**. It demonstrates basic engine initialization, shader management, and 2D rendering.

## **Useful Links ðŸª·**

If you get confused by any part of the code or don't recognize an API call, the engine references might be helpful:

### **[Lotus Module Reference](../module_ref/module_ref.md)**  
The **Lotus API Reference** provides an overview on all the modules, and their layers/sublayers.  
Use this to get a sense of what each module's purpose is, and what the available APIs offer without diving into the code.

### **[Lotus API Reference](../api_ref/api_ref.md)**  
The **Lotus API Reference** provides detailed documentation on all the functions, macros, structures, and utilities available across Lotus modules.  
Use this to get a deeper understanding of the available APIs and how to use them.

## **Next Steps ðŸª·**

- After completing the **Hello Triangle** example, you can explore **Lotus ECS** and **Lotus 2D** in more depth to learn how to build interactive 2D games.  
- Dive deeper into other examples (to be added in the future) and learn how to incorporate more complex features like animations, collisions, and game logic.
