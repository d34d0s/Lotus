## **Navigating the Documentation ðŸª·**

The **Lotus Documentation** is organized into several key sections, each aimed at helping you understand the engine's architecture, the APIs available, and how to use **Lotus** effectively in your projects. Here's a breakdown of the key sections:

### 1. **Module Reference**  
The **Module Reference** is your guide to understanding how different modules in **Lotus** are structured and how they fit together. The **Core Module** provides the foundational systems, and other modules like **ECS**, **2D**, **3D**, and more, build on top of this core functionality. Each module has a reference that includes detailed information on the available functions, structures, and how they interact within the **Lotus** ecosystem.

- **[Lotus Module Reference Hub](../module_ref/hub.md)**: Overview of all modules in **Lotus** with links to individual module references.
- **[Lotus Core Module Reference](../module_ref/core/core.md)**: The foundational **Core** module of **Lotus**, covering the essential layers like **Memory**, **Platform**, **Graphics**, and more.
- **[Lotus ECS Module Reference](../module_ref/ecs/ecs.md)**: Details about the **Entity-Component-System** architecture, and how it is used to manage game objects and behavior.
- **[Lotus 2D Module Reference](../module_ref/2D/2D.md)**: Reference for **Lotus 2D**, which includes tools and systems for 2D game development, including rendering, input, and physics.
- **[Lotus 3D Module Reference](../module_ref/3D/3D.md)**: Reference for **Lotus 3D**, which expands on 2D functionality to include 3D rendering, physics, and scene management.
- **[Lotus Next Module Reference](../module_ref/next/next.md)**: Experimental features in **Lotus**, such as the engine-level plugin API.

### 2. **API Reference**  
The **API Reference** provides a detailed look at all the available functions, macros, structures, and utilities across **Lotus**'s core and modules. Use this to understand the functionality available to you as a developer.

- **[Lotus API Reference Hub](../api_ref/api_ref.md)**: The central reference for all **Lotus** API documentation.
- **[Lotus Core API Reference](../api_ref/core/core.md)**: Detailed documentation of the **Core** layer APIs, including functions related to memory management, platform abstraction, and more.
- **[Lotus ECS API Reference](../api_ref/ecs/ecs.md)**: API documentation for **Lotus ECS**, focusing on entity creation, component management, and system execution.
- **[Lotus 2D API Reference](../api_ref/2D/2D.md)**: The **Lotus 2D API** for handling 2D graphics, meshes, transformations, and input systems.
- **[Lotus 3D API Reference](../api_ref/3D/3D.md)**: The **Lotus 3D API** for managing 3D rendering, meshes, and camera systems.
- **[Lotus Next API Reference](../api_ref/next/next.md)**: API reference for cutting-edge features in **Lotus**, including the plugin system.

### 3. **Examples**  
The **Examples** section contains simple, self-contained examples demonstrating how to use **Lotus** for different purposes. Each example includes explanations and code snippets to help you understand the concepts and features at play.

- **[Lotus Examples Hub](../examples/examples.md)**: A central hub for accessing all the **Lotus** example projects.
- **[Hello Triangle Example](../examples/hello_triangle.md)**: A beginner-friendly example demonstrating how to render a basic triangle using **Lotus 2D** and **ECS**.

## **Using the Documentation ðŸª·**

- **Start with the Basics**: If you're new to **Lotus**, we recommend starting with the **[Hello Triangle](../examples/hello_triangle.md)** example. This will give you a basic understanding of the engineâ€™s structure and provide a hands-on introduction to **Lotus 2D** and **ECS**.
  
- **Dive into the Core**: Once you have an understanding of the basics, explore the **[Lotus Core Module Reference](../module_ref/core/core.md)** and the **[Lotus Core API Reference](../api_ref/core/core.md)** to learn about the foundational layers like **Memory**, **Platform**, and **Graphics**.
  
- **Explore the Modules**: Depending on your project, you may want to dive deeper into the other modules like **ECS**, **2D**, and **3D**. Each module has its own **[Module Reference](../module_ref/module_ref.md)** and **[API Reference](../api_ref/api_ref.md)** to provide comprehensive details on how to utilize the systems and features they offer.

- **Check the Examples**: Each example is designed to teach you a specific feature or workflow in **Lotus**. Check the **[Examples Hub](../examples/examples.md)** for a collection of example projects to help you see how various features come together in a working application.
