# **Lotus 2D Module Reference ðŸª·**

Welcome to the **Lotus 2D Module Reference**! ðŸª·  
The **Lotus 2D** module provides a flexible framework for creating 2D entities and handling their transformations, rendering, and other 2D-specific behaviors. The module integrates seamlessly with the **Lotus ECS** system, allowing you to define 2D components and systems, create reusable prefabs, and manipulate 2D game objects with ease.

### 2D Module Overview ðŸª·

The **Lotus 2D** module includes several features and systems that allow developers to manage and manipulate 2D entities in the game world. Hereâ€™s an overview of the core features and components:

#### Entity Management ðŸª·
- **Purpose**: Manages the creation, destruction, and transformations of 2D entities.
- **Key Structures**:
    - `Lotus_Transform2D`: Holds data for 2D transformations, including position, rotation, scale, velocity, and speed.
    - `Lotus_Mesh2D`: Stores the size, color, and vertex data for 2D meshes (e.g., rectangles, circles).
- **API Reference**: Functions for modifying entity transformations (speed, location, scale, etc.) and mesh data (color, size) are detailed in the **API Reference** section.

#### Transformations ðŸª·
- **Purpose**: Allows developers to apply transformations to 2D entities. This includes setting position, velocity, rotation, and scale, allowing for dynamic updates to entities in the game world.
- **Key Functions**:
    - Functions like `set_speed2D()`, `set_rotation2D()`, `set_scale2D()`, `set_location2D()`, and `set_velocity2D()` manipulate the `Lotus_Transform2D` component to control how entities move, rotate, scale, and interact with other objects.
- **API Reference**: The transformation-related functions are defined in the **API Reference** section.

#### Mesh Management ðŸª·
- **Purpose**: Provides tools for creating and rendering basic 2D shapes like circles, triangles, and rectangles. These shapes can be customized with different sizes and colors.
- **Key Functions**:
    - Functions like `create_circle2D()`, `create_triangle2D()`, and `create_rectangle2D()` create the corresponding mesh data, which can then be used for rendering.
- **API Reference**: The mesh-related functions are listed in the **API Reference** section.

#### Prefab Management ðŸª·
- **Purpose**: Enables developers to create and manage 2D prefabs, which are reusable collections of components that can be quickly instantiated to create entities with predefined properties.
- **Key Structures**:
    - `Lotus_Prefab`: A prefab that holds the IDs of the components that make up the entity.
    - **Prefab Creation**: Prefabs can be instantiated using `create_prefab()` or `create_prefab_ex()` to generate entities with the same configuration, including their transformations and mesh properties.
- **API Reference**: Prefab-related functions for creating and managing 2D prefabs are found in the **API Reference** section.

### Summary ðŸª·

The **Lotus 2D** module provides essential tools for working with 2D entities within the **Lotus** engine. By combining **ECS** architecture with 2D-specific components like `Lotus_Transform2D` and `Lotus_Mesh2D`, the module enables efficient and scalable game development.
