# **Lotus 3D Module Reference ðŸª·**

Welcome to the **Lotus 3D Module Reference**! ðŸª·  
The **Lotus 3D** module provides the tools necessary for working with 3D entities, handling their transformations, rendering, and other 3D-specific behaviors. It integrates seamlessly with the **Lotus ECS** system, enabling the creation of 3D components and systems, and allows for efficient management of 3D game objects.

### 3D Module Overview ðŸª·

The **Lotus 3D** module introduces several features and systems for managing 3D entities within the **Lotus** engine. Here's a high-level overview of the key features:

#### Entity Management ðŸª·
- **Purpose**: Handles the creation, destruction, and transformations of 3D entities.
- **Key Structures**:
    - `Lotus_Transform3D`: Stores the transformation data for 3D entities, including position, rotation, scale, velocity, and speed.
    - `Lotus_Mesh3D`: Holds the size, color, and vertex data for 3D meshes (e.g., cubes, spheres).
- **API Reference**: Functions for manipulating entity transformations (speed, location, rotation, etc.) and mesh data (color, size) are defined in the **API Reference** section.

#### Transformations ðŸª·
- **Purpose**: Allows for the application of transformations (position, rotation, scale) to 3D entities.
- **Key Functions**:
    - Functions like `set_speed3D()`, `set_scale3D()`, `set_rotation3D()`, `set_location3D()`, and `set_velocity3D()` modify the `Lotus_Transform3D` component to control how entities move, rotate, and scale in 3D space.
- **API Reference**: Transformation-related functions are detailed in the **API Reference** section.

#### Mesh Management ðŸª·
- **Purpose**: Provides tools for creating and rendering basic 3D shapes such as cubes. These shapes can be customized with different sizes and colors.
- **Key Functions**:
    - Functions like `create_cube3D()` allow developers to generate vertex data for 3D meshes, which can be used for rendering.
- **API Reference**: The mesh-related functions are listed in the **API Reference** section.

#### Prefab Management ðŸª·
- **Purpose**: Enables the creation and management of 3D prefabsâ€”collections of components that can be reused to instantiate entities with predefined properties.
- **Key Structures**:
    - `Lotus_Prefab`: A prefab that contains the IDs of the components used to create a 3D entity.
    - **Prefab Creation**: Prefabs can be instantiated to create entities with the same set of transformations and mesh properties.
- **API Reference**: Prefab-related functions are found in the **API Reference** section.

### Summary ðŸª·

The **Lotus 3D** module provides essential tools for managing 3D entities within the **Lotus** engine. By leveraging the power of **ECS** architecture with 3D-specific components like `Lotus_Transform3D` and `Lotus_Mesh3D`, developers can efficiently create, manipulate, and render 3D entities. Whether you're building 3D objects, managing their movement, or applying transformations, this module gives you the flexibility and power to work with 3D game entities seamlessly.
