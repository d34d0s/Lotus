# Lotus Module ReferenceðŸª·

Welcome to the **Lotus Module Reference**! ðŸª·  
This section provides a quick overview of all the major modules in **Lotus** and links to their specific **Module References**. The **Module Reference** files provide detailed information about each moduleâ€™s layers, components, and how to use them effectively in your game development projects.

Before diving into each module's documentation, make sure to familiarize yourself with the **[Core Module Reference](core/core.md)**, as it serves as the backbone for all the other modules.

### Quick Links ðŸª·  
| [Lotus Core](core/core.md) | The foundational module of **Lotus**, responsible for essential layers like **Memory**, **Platform**, **Graphics**, and more. |  
| [Lotus ECS](ecs/ecs.md) | The **Entity-Component-System** module, providing a data-driven architecture for game object management and behavior. |  
| [Lotus 2D](2D/2D.md) | A module providing functionality for 2D game development, including graphics, input, and physics systems. |  
| [Lotus 3D](3D/3D.md) | The module for 3D game development, with support for advanced rendering, physics, and scene management. |  
| [Lotus Next](next/next.md) | The **Next-Gen Features** module, which includes experimental features such as the engine-level plugin API and more. |

### How to Use This Guide ðŸª·

- **Start with the Core Module**: Since the **Core Module** provides the foundational systems of **Lotus**, it is essential to understand its structure before moving on to the other modules. Begin by reviewing the **[Core Module Reference](core/core.md)**.
  
- **Explore the Specific Modules**: Once youâ€™re comfortable with the Core module, you can dive into the documentation for any of the other modules:
    - The **[Lotus ECS Reference](ecs/ecs.md)** provides a detailed look at the **Entity-Component-System** architecture.
    - The **[Lotus 2D Reference](2D/2D.md)** focuses on 2D rendering, physics, and related systems.
    - The **[Lotus 3D Reference](3D/3D.md)** covers 3D rendering, physics, and related systems.
    - The **[Lotus Next Reference](next/next.md)** introduces cutting-edge, experimental features like [Lotus Plug](../api_ref/next/plug.md).

- **Follow the Structure**: Each **Module Reference** provides an overview of the module's layers, components, and how to use them effectively. You'll also find API references and examples to help you utilize each module within your projects.
