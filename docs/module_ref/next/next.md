# **Lotus Next Module Reference ðŸª·**  

### **Introduction**  
The **Lotus Next** module serves as a container for experimental and cutting-edge engine features. Unlike core engine modules, which provide foundational systems, **Lotus Next** is designed for forward-thinking enhancements that extend **Lotus** in innovative ways without modifying its core architecture.  

This module acts as a testbed for advanced capabilities and high-level engine extensions. Features introduced here may evolve over time, potentially graduating into core modules or remaining optional experimental tools for developers who need more flexibility.

### **Purpose of Lotus Next ðŸª·**  

The **Lotus Next** module allows for:  
- **Modular Expansion** â€“ New features can be developed, tested, and integrated without altering core engine systems.  
- **Experimental Technology** â€“ Cutting-edge additions that push the boundaries of the engineâ€™s capabilities.  
- **High-Level Engine Extensions** â€“ Systems that integrate deeply with **Lotus** while remaining separate from the core architecture.  

One of the first innovations in **Lotus Next** is **Lotus Plug**, a **fully engine-level plugin system**. Unlike most game engines, which limit plugins to a user-facing scripting layer, **Lotus Plug** enables plugins to interface with and utilize **core engine APIs**, allowing for deeper integration, low-level optimizations, and seamless modular extensions.

### **Current Features of Lotus Next ðŸª·**  

| Feature | Description |  
|---------|------------|  
| **Lotus Plug** | A fully integrated engine-level plugin system that allows dynamic runtime extensions with full access to **Lotus Core APIs**. |  
| **Experimental APIs** *(Planned)* | A collection of cutting-edge features in development for future Lotus versions. |  

---

### **Summary ðŸª·**  

The **Lotus Next** module is the home of experimental and next-generation features that extend the **Lotus** engine beyond its core. With tools like **Lotus Plug**, it enables deeper engine modifications and dynamic extensibility, something rarely found in game engines at this level.
